Avoiding merge conflicts makes you happier. Merge conflicts are annoying. So when I realized that I could sneak a feature in before a teammate so that he/she had to deal with these instead of me, I was super excited.
There’s a BIG difference between a capital letter and a lowercase letter. It took me a while to get used to noticing subtle differences between similar symbols, and it can be pretty frustrating until you get used to it.


It’s ok to admit what you don’t know. When you land your first programming job, you might be inclined to “fake it till you make it.” Don’t. Nobody expects you to know everything right away.
You don’t need to be a math genius. If you’re not a “math person,” that doesn’t mean that you can’t be a programmer.

It doesn’t take 10,000 hours to be good enough to land a job. In reality, you need to be good enough to know how to self correct and get back on track when problems arise. This takes far less time than 10,000 hours.Cheating is completely acceptable. I use Google to solve most of my problems, and so do most programmers.

Learning by yourself is really tough. Talking about code and collaborating with other aspiring developers is a better way to learn for most people.

Pair program as much as possible. There is no faster way to learn how to code.

You’re going to wake up in the morning thinking about code. And when it happens, it’s really freakin’ cool.

Learning to code isn’t easy. But that’s why it’s worth doing.
